 * These tests cover pure logic, so they run in plain Node rather than a React
 * Native runtime. The aliases below stand in for the native modules that the
 * modules under test import at load time — without them, importing a formatter
 * would drag in the whole Expo runtime.
 *
 * Keep the stubs minimal. A stub that grows behaviour is a test asserting
 * against itself; anything that needs a real native module belongs in a device
 * check on the release checklist instead.
