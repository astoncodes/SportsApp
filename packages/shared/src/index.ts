/**

 *
 * Postgres is the source of truth for business rules (docs/architecture.md).
 * The values below are *mirrors* of database constraints, and they exist for
 * one reason: a form needs `maxLength` before the server can reject the input.
 * Enforcement lives in migrations and database functions. If a value here ever
 * disagrees with the database, the database is right and this file is a bug.
 *
 * Do NOT put in this package:
 *   - merge, dedup, or check-in validation logic (lives in database functions)
 *   - anything derived from data (sports, regions — those are queried)
 *   - React components (see packages/ui, which is deliberately not created yet)
